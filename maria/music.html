      <p>Growing up in a multicultural environment has exposed me to a diverse range of genres and artists, from rock music to various forms of electronic music. I enjoy exploring different sounds and styles, but I have a soft spot for soul and reggae, which is why Bob Marley and Marvin Gaye are two of my favorite artists of the 20th century. I even have a collection of their records that I treasure dearly.</p>

      <p>Despite my love for classic soul and reggae, electronic music has captured my heart and imagination. I find myself drawn to the unique beats, mesmerizing rhythms, and infectious energy of this genre. In particular, I dream of one day experiencing the magic of Tomorrowland, one of the world's most iconic electronic music festivals. </p>

      <p>Music is a universal language that transcends borders and brings people together. It enriches our lives, lifts our spirits, and evokes powerful emotions. Can't wait to check the websites of my groupmates and see what they shared! </p>
