            <p>It's hard for me to choose favorite movies in general, but one thing I can say for sure is that I absolutely love Pixar movies. From Toy Story to Soul, there's just something so special about the way these films are made.</p>

            <p>One of the things I appreciate most about Pixar movies is how they are able to touch on such deep and emotional themes in a way that is accessible to audiences of all ages. Toy Story, for example, explores the idea of growing up and moving on from things we once held dear. And in Soul, we are presented with a thought-provoking and heartfelt story about the meaning of life and the pursuit of one's passions.</p>

            <p>But it's not just the themes that make Pixar movies so great. The animation is always top-notch, and the characters are so well-developed that it's easy to become emotionally invested in their stories. Whether it's Woody and Buzz Lightyear in Toy Story or Joe Gardner in Soul, Pixar movies always seem to have a way of making us care deeply about the characters on screen.</p>

            <p> All in all, Pixar movies never fail to make me laugh, cry, and feel a whole range of emotions. And I'm grateful that these films exist to remind us all of the power of storytelling and the magic of animation! </p>

            <p> Here is a fragment from Pixar's Soul :) </p>
