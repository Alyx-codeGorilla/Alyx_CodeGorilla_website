                <h3>Java Programming</h3>
                <ul>I have been actively learning Java, mastering the basics and building a strong foundation in programming. I can now write basic programs and solve various riddles and mathematical tasks using Java. This has significantly boosted my problem-solving skills and logical thinking.</ul>

                <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
                <ul>In addition to Java, I am refreshing my knowledge in HTML and CSS. I am working on improving my web development skills to create visually appealing and responsive web pages. Understanding these fundamental technologies is crucial for building modern web applications.</ul>

                <h3>Projects Completed</h3>
                <ul>Throughout the bootcamp, I have successfully completed several projects. These projects have allowed me to apply my knowledge in practical scenarios, reinforcing my learning and giving me hands-on experience. Each project has been a stepping stone towards becoming a proficient developer.</ul>

                <h3>Hyperskill Streak</h3>
                <ul>I am currently on a learning streak in Hyperskill, a platform that provides structured learning paths and interactive coding challenges. This streak has kept me motivated and committed to my learning goals, ensuring consistent progress and continuous improvement.</ul>

                <p>Thank you for following my journey! I am eager to continue learning and developing my skills, and I look forward to sharing more updates with you.</p>
