        <p>I enjoy food, and I've come to realize that I'm really drawn to Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine. The flavors are just so rich and satisfying.</p>
        <p>When it comes to dessert, I have a bit of a sweet tooth. Okay, let's be honest, I can't resist anything sweet! Cakes, pies, baklava, you name it. I just love indulging in something delicious after a meal. </p>
        <p>As a teenager, I even had my own little business making cakes and desserts for people. It was a lot of work, but it was also really rewarding to see how much people enjoyed what I made. Here are some pictures of my cakes: </p>
