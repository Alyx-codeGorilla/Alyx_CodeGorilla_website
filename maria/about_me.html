            <p>As I previously told you, my name is Maria, and I am a Master's student and CJIB trainee living in Groningen. Above you can see my photo, and if you click it, you will be taken to the pages dedicated to music, food and movies I like! &#x2665; </p>
            <p>I love Groningen for its scenic beauty, its friendly people, and its vibrant culture. In my free time, I like to explore the city and discover new places to visit. However, my greatest passion is travelling. I believe that travelling is not only a great way to learn about new cultures and traditions, but it also broadens your horizons and helps you see the world from a different perspective. That's why I try to travel as much as possible, both within the Netherlands and abroad. </p>
            <p>In the past year, I travelled to 10 countries and visited around 20 cities, but my favorite destinations were Positano and Pompeii in Italy, and Dubai in the UAE. Usually I prefer places with warm weather, and you can see it in the pictures I took travelling to my favorite destinations:</p>
