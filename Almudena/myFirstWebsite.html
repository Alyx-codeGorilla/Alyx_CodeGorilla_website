    I attempted once to do a <em>website</em>, but hopefully in the near future it will look nicer. For now I am just adding the basics of <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> that I know out of the top of my head.
<div id="paragraph">
    I am now going to link another website so you can see that I know how to:
</div>
<div id="paragraph">
    <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/html">The Ultimate guide to HTML for Beginners</a>
</div>
</p>
<p id="paragraph">
    And now I will also add a cool photo and a line:

    <button id="button">
        Hellooo
    </button>

</body>
