# AlyxCodeGorilla website

Our goal was to collaborate as a team to create our own website and then make a html page with links to our own websites
and on our own website we had to make a return to main page button.

We took the following steps to achieve this goal:
1. We created all our own Github accounts
2. Send out GH account name in Teams to be added in a team.
3. Created a GH team to collaborate
4. Then we created a repository in the team hub
5. Go to repository and "clone from the internet" to your local.
6. Work in Terminal/GH Desktop or IDE to upload folders > copy and paste your folder to the cloned folder,
   Write a summary & description of your change and commit your clone.
7. Create an HTML file (and a .CSS for it) that will have the links to all our websites
8. Make an online page. GH does that automatically.
